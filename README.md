# Before you start contributing you'll need this to work
`cd FrugalApp`

`npm install`

`nodemon app.js`

This will install all the dependencies for our express application. 

Using `nodemon` instead of `npm start` allows the server to restart itself when any of the back-end code changes (So we don't need to stop and start the server ourselves each time we make a change).

# To start the server
`npm start`

This might be changed in the future

Read over the express example app to learn more about javascript :)
